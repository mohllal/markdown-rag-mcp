# Tasks: Markdown RAG System (Core Library)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-markdown-rag-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: TDD workflow enforced - tests MUST be written first and FAIL before implementation begins per constitutional requirement III.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Core library in `src/markdown_rag_mcp/`
- Test structure: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/contract/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan with directories: `src/markdown_rag_mcp/`, `tests/`, `docker/`, `examples/`
- [x] T002 Initialize Python 3.12.0 project with pyproject.toml and core dependencies (LangChain, HuggingFaceEmbeddings, python-frontmatter, Milvus)
- [x] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (ruff, black)
- [x] T004 [P] Create Docker Compose configuration in `docker/docker-compose.yml` for Milvus ecosystem (etcd, MinIO, Milvus)
- [x] T005 [P] Create development Dockerfile in `docker/Dockerfile.dev` for Python 3.12.0 environment

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Create abstract interfaces in `src/markdown_rag_mcp/core/interfaces.py` for IRAGEngine, IVectorStore, IEmbeddingProvider, IDocumentParser
- [x] T007 [P] Create base data models in `src/markdown_rag_mcp/models/__init__.py` for Document, DocumentSection, QueryResult
- [x] T008 [P] Implement configuration management in `src/markdown_rag_mcp/config/settings.py` with environment variable support
- [x] T009 [P] Create error handling classes in `src/markdown_rag_mcp/models/exceptions.py` for `BaseError`, `MilvusConnectionError`, `EmbeddingModelError`
- [x] T010 Setup Milvus connection and collection management in `src/markdown_rag_mcp/storage/base_store.py`
- [x] T011 Initialize main library exports in `src/markdown_rag_mcp/__init__.py` exposing core interfaces

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Query Relevant Documentation (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 components but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1/US2 components but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written first and FAIL before implementation (TDD requirement)
- Models before services
- Services before orchestration
- Core implementation before CLI integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models and parsers within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (TDD - write first):
Task: "Contract test for RAGEngine.search() interface in tests/contract/test_core_interfaces/test_rag_engine.py"
Task: "Integration test for end-to-end query workflow in tests/integration/test_end_to_end/test_basic_search.py"
Task: "Unit tests for markdown parsing in tests/unit/test_parsers/test_markdown_parser.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement document models in src/markdown_rag_mcp/models/document.py"
Task: "Implement query models in src/markdown_rag_mcp/models/query.py"
Task: "Implement markdown parser in src/markdown_rag_mcp/parsers/markdown_parser.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic semantic search)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently using quickstart.md scenarios
5. Deploy/demo core RAG functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP - Basic semantic search!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Enhanced search with frontmatter)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Automatic index updates)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Core search functionality)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Frontmatter enhancement)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Incremental updates)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD CRITICAL**: Verify tests fail before implementing (constitutional requirement)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Focus on library-first architecture - CLI serves as reference implementation
- Maintain >0.7 similarity threshold and 85% accuracy targets
- Support up to 1000 markdown files and 10GB collections
- **Total Tasks: 75**
