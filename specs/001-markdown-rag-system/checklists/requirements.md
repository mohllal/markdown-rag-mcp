# Specification Quality Checklist: Markdown RAG System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Details (Updated 2025-10-08)

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS

- Spec focuses on WHAT users need (semantic search, frontmatter utilization) rather than HOW to implement
- Written for business stakeholders with clear user value propositions
- No technology-specific implementation details in requirements

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS

- All 10 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria include specific metrics (3 seconds, 85% accuracy, 30 seconds, 10GB)
- Success criteria are user-focused (find relevant information, achieve accuracy, process files)
- Edge cases cover key failure scenarios
- Assumptions section clearly documents dependencies

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS

- Each user story has independent test scenarios
- Priority ordering allows for MVP development (P1 = core search, P2 = frontmatter utilization, P3 = incremental)
- Success criteria map to user scenarios and business value

### Changes Made

- Updated FR-005 and FR-006 to focus on parsing/utilizing existing frontmatter
- Updated success criteria to measure frontmatter effectiveness rather than generation accuracy
